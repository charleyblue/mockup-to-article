You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

1. I have learned about HTML5 elements and using them to write tags that contain the contents of a web page. Tags are the HTML code that the browser understands and renders the content inside of the tags on the web page.
Elements such as <em>emphasis</em>, <q>quotation</q>, <sup>super script</sup>, <p>paragraph</p>, <header>header</header>, <article>article</article>, <section>section</section>, <footer>footer</footer>. Image tags, <img src="" alt="">, thematic break <hr> do not have closing tags
2. This has been an excellent review of HTML basics and the practice exercises have help reinforce the concepts.
3. Organizing my time for study in relation to the other daily responsibilities.
4. I have used the positive reinforcement methods such as saying things like, "Oh, I see now and learned something new" or acknowledged a deeper understanding of a subject. Using a reset when something isn't making sense by asking if there is a different way of looking at the problem.
