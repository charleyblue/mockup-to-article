# mockup-to-article
My Udacity FEND project HTML5 code for the mock-up of the AlphaGo - Humans vs Machines - article. Used an absolute path to add a GIF 
image to the document. Used semantic tags to divide the page into sections and wrapped the whole article in an article tag. I used an 
inline CSS style width and margin to center the article within 75% of the viewport.
